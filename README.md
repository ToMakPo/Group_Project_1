## Future Development
```
We would like to make the game more fun with a multi player mode so others can join the same game.
Instant messaging would be part of the technologie used.
This game could have a waiting room for players, in multi player mode, to wait in until their game is ready.
Players would input their own answer to the trivia question.
Players of the game would get presented with all the user answers plus a correct answer.
Points are given for: having your answer picked as a right answer, picking the right answer, and being first to pick the right answer.  
We would also like to add background music and sound effects to make game more attractive. 
We would also like to add an avatar api that users could select as theirs for the game. 
Somehow let the avatars interact with eachother in the waiting room. 
Also, to have user's info and avatar stored for future games.
